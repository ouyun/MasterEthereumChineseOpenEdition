= The ERC20 Token Standard

The ERC20 standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party. It is documented in https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20-token-standard.md[EIP-20 Token Standard]

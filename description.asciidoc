If you're looking to get started with the Ethereum protocol--or are among the many open source developers, integrators, and system administrators already working with this platform--Mastering Ethereum is the definitive book on the topic.

Ethereum represents the gateway to a worldwide, decentralized computing paradigm. This platform enables you to run decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts that have no central points of failure or control, integrate with a payment network, and operate on an open blockchain. With this practical guide, Andreas M. Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood provide everything you need to know about building smart contracts and DApps on Ethereum and other virtual-machine blockchains.

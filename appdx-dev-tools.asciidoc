=== Frameworks

((("frameworks", id="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc0", range="startofrange")))Frameworks can be used to ease Ethereum smart contract development. By doing everything yourself you get a better understanding of how everything fits together, but it's a lot of tedious, repetitive work. The frameworks described in this section can automate certain tasks and make development easier.

[[installing_truffle]]
===== Installing the Truffle framework

((("Node.js")))((("Truffle","installing")))The Truffle framework comprises several Node.js packages. Before you install +Truffle+, you need to have an up-to-date and working installation of Node.js and the Node Package Manager (+npm+).

The recommended way to install Node.js and +npm+ is to use the Node Version Manager (+nvm+). Once you install +nvm+, it will handle all the dependencies and updates for you. Follow the instructions found at http://nvm.sh[].

Once +nvm+ is installed on your operating system, installing Node.js is simple. Use the +--lts+ flag to tell +nvm+ that you want the most recent &#x201c;long-term support&#x201d; (LTS) version of Node.js:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ <strong>nvm install --lts</strong>
</pre>
++++

Confirm you have +node+ and +npm+ installed:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ <strong>node -v</strong>
v12.16.1
$ <strong>npm -v</strong>
6.13.4
</pre>
++++

Next, create a hidden file, _.nvmrc_, that contains the Node.js version supported by your DApp so developers just need to run `nvm install` in the root of the project directory and it will automatically install and switch to using that version:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ <strong>node -v &gt; .nvmrc</strong>
$ <strong>nvm install</strong>
</pre>
++++

Looking good. Now to install +Truffle+:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ <strong>npm -g install truffle</strong>

+ truffle@5.1.20
added 26 packages from 438 contributors and updated 1 package in 24.229s
</pre>
++++

[[truffle_box]]
===== Integrating a prebuilt Truffle project (Truffle Box)

((("Truffle","integrating a prebuilt Truffle project")))((("Truffle Box")))If you want to use or create a DApp that builds upon prebuilt boilerplate, go to the Truffle Boxes website, choose an existing Truffle project, and then run the following command to download and extract it:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ <strong>truffle unbox <em>BOX_NAME</em></strong>
</pre>
++++

[[truffle_project_directory]]
===== Creating a Truffle project directory

((("Truffle","creating a project directory", id="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc3", range="startofrange")))For each project where you will use +Truffle+, create a project directory and initialize +Truffle+ within that directory. +Truffle+ will create the necessary directory structure inside your project directory. It's customary to give the project directory a name that describes the project. For this example, we will use +Truffle+ to deploy our +Faucet+ contract from <<simple_contract_example>>, and therefore we will name the project folder __Faucet__:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ <strong>mkdir Faucet</strong>
$ <strong>cd Faucet</strong>
Faucet $
</pre>
++++

Once inside the _Faucet_ directory, we initialize +Truffle+:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
Faucet $ <strong>truffle init</strong>
</pre>
++++

+Truffle+ creates a directory structure and some default files:

----
Faucet
+---- contracts
|   `---- Migrations.sol
+---- migrations
|   `---- 1_initial_migration.js
+---- test
`---- truffle-config.js
----

We will also use a number of JavaScript (Node.js) support packages, in addition to +Truffle+ itself. We can install these with +npm+. We initialize the +npm+ directory structure and accept the defaults suggested by +npm+:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ <strong>npm init</strong>

package name: (faucet)
version: (1.0.0)
description:
entry point: (truffle-config.js)
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
author:
license: (ISC)
About to write to Faucet/package.json:

{
  "name": "faucet",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "truffle-config.js",
  "directories": {
    "test": "test"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" &amp;&amp; exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}


Is this ok? (yes)
</pre>
++++

Now, we can install the dependencies that we will use to make working with +Truffle+ easier:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ <strong>npm install dotenv truffle-wallet-provider ethereumjs-wallet</strong>
</pre>
++++

We now have a __node_modules__ directory with several thousand files inside our _Faucet_ directory.

Prior to deploying a DApp to a cloud production or continuous integration environment, it is important to specify the +engines+ field so that your DApp is built with the correct Node.js version and its associated dependencies are installed. For details on configuring this field, see the http://bit.ly/2zp2GPF[documentation].(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc3")))

===== Configuring Truffle

((("Truffle","configuring")))+Truffle+ creates an empty configuration file, _truffle-config.js_. Now we edit _truffle-config.js_ and replace the contents with the sample configuation shown here:

[source,javascript]
----
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    localnode: { // Whatever network our local node connects to
      network_id: "*", // Match any network ID
      host: "localhost",
      port: 8545,
    }
  }
};
----

This configuration is a good starting point. It sets up one default Ethereum network (named +localnode+), which assumes we are running an Ethereum client such as Parity, either as a full node or as a light client. This configuration will instruct +Truffle+ to communicate with the local node over RPC, on port 8545. +Truffle+ will use whatever Ethereum network the local node is connected to, such as the Ethereum main network, or a test network like Ropsten. The local node will also be providing the wallet functionality.

In following sections, we will configure additional networks for +Truffle+ to use, such as the +ganache+ local test blockchain and Infura, a hosted network provider. As we add more networks, the configuration file will get more complex, but it will also give us more options for our testing and development workflow.

===== Using Truffle to deploy a contract

((("smart contracts","using Truffle to deploy")))((("Truffle","contract deployment with")))We now have a basic working directory for our _Faucet_ project, and we have +Truffle+ and its dependencies configured. Contracts go in the _contracts_ subdirectory of our project. The directory already contains a "helper" contract, _Migrations.sol_, which manages contract upgrades for us. We'll examine the use of _Migrations.sol_ in the next section.

Let's copy the _Faucet.sol_ contract (from <<solidity_faucet_example>>) into the _contracts_ subdirectory, so that the project directory looks like this:

----
Faucet
+---- contracts
|   +---- Faucet.sol
|   `---- Migrations.sol
...
----

We can now ask +Truffle+ to compile the contract for us:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ <strong>truffle compile</strong>
Compiling ./contracts/Faucet.sol...
Compiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol...
Writing artifacts to ./build/contracts
</pre>
++++

[[truffle_migrations_understanding_deployment_scripts]]
===== Truffle migrations&#x2014;understanding deployment scripts

((("deployment scripts", id="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc4", range="startofrange")))((("migrations", id="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc5", range="startofrange")))((("Truffle","migrations", id="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc6", range="startofrange")))Truffle offers a deployment system called a _migration_. If you have worked in other frameworks, you may have seen something similar: Ruby on Rails, Python Django, and many other languages and frameworks have a +migrate+ command.

In all those frameworks, the purpose of a migration is to handle changes in the data schema between different versions of the software. The purpose of migrations in Ethereum is slightly different. Because Ethereum contracts are immutable and cost gas to deploy, Truffle offers a migration mechanism to keep track of which contracts (and which versions) have already been deployed. In a complex project with dozens of contracts and complex dependencies, you would not want to have to pay to redeploy contracts that haven't changed. You would also not want to manually track which versions of which contracts have been deployed already. The Truffle migration mechanism does all that by deploying the smart contract _Migrations.sol_, which then keeps track of all other contract deployments.

We have only one contract, _Faucet.sol_, which means that the migration system is overkill, to say the least. Unfortunately, we have to use it. But, by learning how to use it for one contract, we can start practicing some good habits for our development workflow. The effort will pay off as things get more complicated.

Truffle's _migrations_ directory is where the migration scripts are found. Right now there's only one script, __1_initial_migration.js__, which deploys the _Migrations.sol_ contract itself:


[source,javascript,linenums]
----
include::code/truffle/Faucet/migrations/1_initial_migration.js[]
----

We need a second migration script, to deploy _Faucet.sol_. Let's call it __2_deploy_contracts.js__. It is very simple, just like __1_initial_migration.js__, with only a few small changes. In fact, you can copy the contents of __1_initial_migration.j__ and simply replace all instances of +Migrations+ with +Faucet+:

[source,javascript,linenums]
----
include::code/truffle/Faucet/migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js[]
----

The script initializes a variable +Faucet+, identifying the _Faucet.sol_ Solidity source code as the artifact that defines +Faucet+. Then it calls the `deploy` function to deploy this contract.

We're all set. Let's use +truffle migrate+ to deploy it on. We have to specify which network to deploy the contract, using the +--network+ argument. We only have one network specified in the configuration file, which we named +localnode+. Make sure your local Ethereum client is running and then type:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
Faucet $ <strong>truffle migrate --network localnode</strong>
</pre>
++++

Because we are using a local node to connect to the Ethereum network and manage our wallet, we have to authorize the transaction that +Truffle+ creates. We're running +parity+ connected to the Ropsten test blockchain, so during the migration we'll see a pop-up like the one in <<parity_deployment_confirmation>> on Parity's web console.

[[parity_deployment_confirmation]]
.Parity asking for confirmation to deploy Faucet
image::images/parity_deployment_confirmation.png["Parity asking for confirmation to deploy Faucet"]

There are four transactions in total: one to deploy +Migrations+, one to update the deployments counter to +1+, one to deploy +Faucet+, and one to update the deployments counter to +2+.

Truffle will show the migrations completing, show each of the transactions, and show the contract addresses:(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc6")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc5")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc4")))

++++

===== Using the Truffle console

((("Truffle","console", id="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc7", range="startofrange")))Truffle offers a JavaScript console that we can use to interact with the Ethereum network (via the local node), interact with deployed contracts, and interact with the wallet provider. In our current configuration (+localnode+), the node and wallet provider is our local Parity client.

Let's start the Truffle console and try some commands:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ <strong>truffle console --network localnode</strong>
truffle(localnode)>
</pre>
++++

Truffle presents a prompt, showing the selected network configuration (+localnode+).

[TIP]
====
It's important to remember and be aware of which network you are using. You wouldn't want to accidentally deploy a test contract or make a transaction on the Ethereum main network. That could be an expensive mistake!
====

The Truffle console offers an autocomplete function that makes it easy for us to explore the environment. If we press Tab after a partially completed command, Truffle will complete the command for us. Pressing Tab twice will show all possible completions if more than one command matches our input. In fact, if we press Tab twice on an empty prompt, Truffle lists all the available commands:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting" class="codewrap">

</pre>
++++

The vast majority of the wallet- and node-related functions are provided by the +web3+ object, which is an instance of the web3.js library. The +web3+ object abstracts the RPC interface to our Parity node. You will also notice two objects with familiar names: +Migrations+ and +Faucet+. Those represent the contracts we just deployed. We will use the Truffle console to interact with a contract. First, let's check our wallet via the +web3+ object:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
truffle(localnode)&gt; <strong>web3.eth.accounts</strong>
[ '0x9e713963a92c02317a681b9bb3065a8249de124f',
  '0xdb5dc1a13e3a55cf3b4587cd8d1e5fdeb6738145' ]
</pre>
++++

Our Parity client has two wallets, with some test ether on Ropsten. The +web3.eth.accounts+ attribute contains a list of all the accounts. We can check the balance of the first account using the +getBalance+ function:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
truffle(localnode)&gt; <strong>web3.eth.getBalance(web3.eth.accounts[0]).toNumber()</strong>
191198572800000000
truffle(localnode)&gt;
</pre>
++++

web3.js is a large JavaScript library that offers a comprehensive interface to the Ethereum system, via a provider such as a local client. We will examine web3.js in more detail in <<web3js_tutorial>>. Now let's try to interact with our contracts:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
truffle(localnode)&gt; <strong>Faucet.address</strong>
'0xd01cd8e7bd29e4bff8c1693f59eee46137a9f300'
truffle(localnode)&gt; <strong>web3.eth.getBalance(Faucet.address).toNumber()</strong>
0
truffle(localnode)&gt;
</pre>
++++

Next, we'll use +sendTransaction+ to send some test ether to fund the +Faucet+ contract. Note the use of +web3.utils.toWei+ to convert ether units for us. Typing 18 zeros without making a mistake is both difficult and dangerous, so it's always better to use a unit converter for values. Here's how we send the transaction:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
truffle(localnode)&gt; <strong>web3.eth.sendTransaction({from:web3.eth.accounts[0],
                    to:Faucet.address, value:web3.utils.toWei(0.5, 'ether')});</strong>
'0xf134c75b985dc0e0c27c2f0412251e0860eb530a5055e660f21e7483ab336808'
</pre>
++++

If we switch to the Parity web interface, we'll see a pop-up asking us to confirm this transaction. Once the transaction is mined, we'll be able to see the balance of our +Faucet+ contract:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
truffle(localnode)&gt; <strong>web3.eth.getBalance(Faucet.address).toNumber()</strong>
500000000000000000
</pre>
++++

Let's call the +withdraw+ function now, to withdraw some test ether from the contract:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
truffle(localnode)&gt; <strong>Faucet.deployed().then(instance =>
                       {instance.withdraw(web3.utils.toWei(0.1,
                       'ether'))}).then(console.log)</strong>
</pre>
++++

Again, we'll need to approve the transaction in the Parity web interface. If we check again we'll see that the balance of the +Faucet+ contract has decreased, and our test wallet has received 0.1 ether(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc7"))):(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc2")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc1")))

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
truffle(localnode)&gt; <strong>web3.eth.getBalance(Faucet.address).toNumber()</strong>
400000000000000000
truffle(localnode)&gt; <strong>Faucet.deployed().then(instance =>
                    {instance.withdraw(web3.utils.toWei(1, 'ether'))})</strong>
StatusError: Transaction: 0xe147ae9e3610334...8612b92d3f9c 
  exited with an error (status 0).
</pre>

==== OpenZeppelin

((("frameworks","OpenZeppelin suite", id="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc8", range="startofrange")))((("OpenZeppelin", id="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc9", range="startofrange")))GitHub: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity[]

Website: https://openzeppelin.org/[]

Documentation: https://openzeppelin.org/api/docs/open-zeppelin.html[]

https://openzeppelin.org/[OpenZeppelin] is an open framework of reusable and secure smart contracts in the Solidity language.

It is community-driven, led by the https://zeppelin.solutions/[Zeppelin] team, with over a hundred external contributors. The main focus of the framework is security, achieved by applying industry-standard contract security patterns and best practices, drawing on all the experience the Zeppelin devs have gained from https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/tagged/security[auditing] a huge number of contracts, and through constant testing and auditing from the community that uses the framework as a base for their real-world applications.

The OpenZeppelin framework is the most widely used solution for Ethereum smart contracts. The framework currently has an ample library of contracts including implementations of ERC20 and ERC721 tokens, many flavors of crowdsale models, and simple behaviors commonly found in contracts such as `Ownable`, `Pausable`, or `LimitBalance`. The contracts in this repository in some cases function as _de facto_ standard implementations.

The framework is licensed under an MIT license, and all the contracts have been designed with a modular approach to guarantee ease of reuse and extension. These are clean and basic building blocks, ready to be used in your next Ethereum project. Let's set up the framework and build a simple crowdsale using the OpenZeppelin contracts, to demonstrate how easy it is to use. This example also stresses the importance of reusing secure components instead of writing them by yourself.

First, we will need to install the +openzeppelin-solidity+ library into our workspace. The latest release as of the time of this writing is v1.9.0, so we will use that one:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ <strong>mkdir sample-crowdsale</strong>
$ <strong>cd sample-crowdsale</strong>
$ <strong>npm install openzeppelin-solidity@1.9.0</strong>
$ <strong>mkdir contracts</strong>
</pre>
++++

At the time of writing, OpenZeppelin includes multiple basic token contracts that follow the ERC20, ERC721, and ERC827 standards, with different characteristics for emission, limits, vesting, life cycle, etc.

Let's make an ERC20 token that's mintable, meaning that the initial supply starts at 0 and new tokens can be created by the token owner (in our case, the crowdsale pass:[<span class="keep-together">contract</span>]) and sold to buyers. In order to do this, we'll create a _contracts/SampleToken.sol_ file with the following contents:

[source,solidity]
----
include::code/OpenZeppelin/contracts/SampleToken.sol[]
----

OpenZeppelin already provides a +MintableToken+ contract that we can use as a base for our token, so we only define the details that are specific to our case. Next, let's make the crowdsale contract. Just like with tokens, OpenZeppelin already provides a wide variety of crowdsale flavors. Currently, you will find contracts for various scenarios involving distribution, emission, price, and validation. So, let’s say that you want to set a goal for your crowdsale and if it’s not met by the time the sale finishes, you want to refund all your investors. For that, you can use the http://bit.ly/2yHoh65[+RefundableCrowdsale+] contract. Or maybe you want to define a crowdsale with an increasing price to incentivize early buyers; there is an http://bit.ly/2PtWOys[+IncreasingPriceCrowdsale+] contract just for that. You can also end the crowdsale when a specified amount of ether has been received by the contract (http://bit.ly/2OVsCN8[+CappedCrowdsale+]), or set a finishing time with the http://bit.ly/2zp2Nuz[+TimedCrowdsale+] contract, or create a whitelist of buyers with the http://bit.ly/2CN8Hc9[+WhitelistedCrowdsale+] contract.

As we said before, the OpenZeppelin contracts are basic building blocks. These crowdsale contracts have been designed to be combined; just read the source code of the base http://bit.ly/2ABIQSI[+Crowdsale+] contract for directions on how to extend it. For the crowdsale of our token, we need to mint tokens when ether is received by the crowdsale contract, so let's use http://bit.ly/2Sx3HOc[+MintedCrowdsale+] as a base. And to make it more interesting, let's also make it a http://bit.ly/2Qef0Jm[+PostDeliveryCrowdsale+] so the tokens can only be withdrawn after the crowdsale ends. To do this, we'll write the following into _contracts/SampleCrowdsale.sol_:

[source,solidity]
----
include::code/OpenZeppelin/contracts/SampleCrowdsale.sol[]
----

Again, we barely had to write any code; we just reused the battle-tested code that the OpenZeppelin community made available. However, it is important to note that this case is different than that of our `SampleToken` contract. If you go to the http://bit.ly/2Q8lQ3o[Crowdsale automated tests] you will see that they are tested in isolation. When you integrate different units of code into a bigger component, it's not enough to test all the units separately, because the interactions between them might cause behaviors that you didn't expect. In particular, you will see that here we introduced multiple inheritance, which can surprise the developer if they don't understand the details of Solidity. Our pass:[<span class="keep-together"><code>SampleCrowdsale</code></span>] contract is simple, and it will work just as we expect because the framework was designed to make cases like these straightforward; but do not relax your vigilance because of the simplicity that this framework introduces. Every time you integrate parts of the OpenZeppelin framework to build a more complex solution, you must fully test every aspect of your solution to ensure that all the interactions of the units work as you intend.

Finally, when we are happy with our solution and have tested it thoroughly, we need to deploy it. OpenZeppelin integrates well with Truffle, so we can just write a migrations file like the following (_migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js_), as explained in <<truffle_migrations_understanding_deployment_scripts>>:

==== ZeppelinOS

((("frameworks","ZeppelinOS")))((("ZeppelinOS")))GitHhub: https://github.com/zeppelinos[]

Website: https://zeppelinos.org[]

Blog: https://blog.zeppelinos.org[]

https://github.com/zeppelinos[ZeppelinOS] is &#x201c;an open source, distributed platform of tools and services on top of the EVM
to develop and manage smart contract applications securely.&#x201d;

Unlike OpenZeppelin's code, which needs to be redeployed with each application every time it's used, ZeppelinOS's code lives on-chain. Applications that need a given functionality&#x2014;say, an ERC20 token&#x2014;not only do not have to redesign and reaudit its implementation (something that OpenZeppelin solved) but do not even need to deploy it. With ZeppelinOS, an application interacts with the token's on-chain implementation directly, in much the same way as a desktop application interacts with the components of its underlying OS.

((("proxy")))At the core of ZeppelinOS sits a very clever contract known as a _proxy_. A proxy is a contract that is capable of wrapping any other contract, exposing its interface without having to manually implement setters and getters for it, and can upgrade it without losing state. In Solidity terms, it can be seen as a normal contract whose business logic is contained within a library, which can be swapped for a new library at any time without losing its state. The way in which the proxy links to its implementation is completely automated and encapsulated for the developer. Practically any contract can be made upgradeable with little to no change in its code. More about ZeppelinOS's proxy mechanism can be found in the  http://bit.ly/2OfuNpu[blog], and an example of how to use it can be found http://bit.ly/2OfuE5q[on GitHub].

Developing applications using ZeppelinOS is similar to developing JavaScript applications using +npm+. An +AppManager+ handles an application package for each version of the application. A package is simply a directory of contracts, each of which can have one or more upgradeable proxies. The +AppManager+ not only provides proxies for application-specific contracts, but also does so for ZeppelinOS implementations, in the form of a standard library. To see a full example of this, please visit http://bit.ly/2PtyJb3[examples/complex].

Although currently in development, ZeppelinOS aims to provide a wide set of additional features, such as developer tools, a scheduler that automates background operations within contracts, development bounties, a marketplace that facilitates communication and exchange of value between applications, and much more. All of this is described in ZeppelinOS's http://bit.ly/2QcxV7K[whitepaper].(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc0")))

[[testing_frameworks]]
=== Testing Smart Contracts

((("frameworks","for smart contract development", id="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc11", range="startofrange")))((("smart contracts","test frameworks", id="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc12", range="startofrange")))((("test frameworks","for smart contract development", id="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc13", range="startofrange")))There are several commonly used test frameworks for smart contract development, summarized in <<testing_frameworks_table>>:

[[testing_frameworks_table]]
[options="header"]
.Smart contract test frameworks summary
|=======
|Framework | Test language(s)    | Testing framework | Chain emulator       | Website
|Truffle   | JavaScript/Solidity | Mocha             | TestRPC/Ganache      | https://trufflesuite.com/[]
|Embark    | JavaScript          | Mocha             | TestRPC/Ganache      | https://embark.status.im/docs/[]

|Populus   | Python              | +pytest+             | Python chain emulator| https://populus.readthedocs.io[]
|=======


Truffle:: ((("Truffle","as test framework")))Truffle allows for unit tests to be written in JavaScript (Mocha-based) or Solidity. These tests are run against Ganache.

Embark:: ((("Embark")))Embark integrates with Mocha to run unit tests written in JavaScript. The tests are in turn run against contracts deployed on Ganache (formerly called TestRPC). The Embark framework automatically deploys smart contracts, and will automatically redeploy the contracts when they are changed. It also keeps track of deployed contracts and deploys contracts only when truly needed. Embark includes a testing library to rapidly run and test your contracts in an EVM, with functions like +assert.equal+. The command +embark test+ will run any test files under the directory _test_.

Dapp:: ((("Dapp")))Dapp uses native Solidity code (a library called +ds-test+) and a Parity-built Rust library called +ethrun+ to execute Ethereum bytecode and then assert correctness. The +ds-test+ library provides assertion functions for validating correctness and events for logging data in the console.
+
The assertion functions include:
+
----
assert(bool condition)
assertEq(address a, address b)
assertEq(bytes32 a, bytes32 b)
assertEq(int a, int b)
assertEq(uint a, uint b)
assertEq0(bytes a, bytes b)
expectEventsExact(address target)
----
+
The logging commands will log information to the console, making them useful for debugging:
+
----
logs(bytes)
log_bytes32(bytes32)
log_named_bytes32(bytes32 key, bytes32 val)
log_named_address(bytes32 key, address val)
log_named_int(bytes32 key, int val)
log_named_uint(bytes32 key, uint val)
log_named_decimal_int(bytes32 key, int val, uint decimals)
log_named_decimal_uint(bytes32 key, uint val, uint decimals)
----

Populus:: ((("Populus")))Populus uses Python and its own chain emulator to run contracts written in Solidity. Unit tests are written in Python with the +pytest+ library. Populus supports writing contracts specifically for testing. These contract filenames should match the glob pattern _Test*.sol_ and be located anywhere under the project tests directory, _tests_.


[[on_blockchain_testing_sec]]
==== On-Blockchain Testing

((("blockchain","on-blockchain testing")))((("test frameworks","on-blockchain testing")))Although most testing shouldn't occur on deployed contracts, a contract's behavior can be checked via Ethereum clients.  The following commands can be used to assess a smart contract's state. These commands should be typed at the +geth+ terminal, although any web3 console will also support them.

To get the address of a contract at __++txhash++__, use:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
web3.eth.getTransactionReceipt(<em>txhash</em>);
</pre>
++++


This command gets the code of a contract deployed at __++contractaddress++__; this can be used to verify proper deployment:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
web3.eth.getCode(<em>contractaddress</em>)
</pre>
++++

This gets the full logs of the contract located at the address specified in __++options++__, which is helpful for viewing the history of a contract's calls:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
web3.eth.getPastLogs(<em>options</em>)
</pre>
++++

Finally, this command gets the storage located at __++address++__ with an offset of __++position++__:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
web3.eth.getStorageAt(<em>address</em>, <em>position</em>)
</pre>
++++

[[ganache]]
==== Ganache: A Local Test Blockchain

((("Ganache","local blockchain testing with")))Ganache is a local test blockchain that you can use to deploy contracts, develop your applications, and run tests. It is available as a desktop application (with a graphical user interface) for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is also available as a command-line utility called +ganache-cli+. For more details and installation instructions for the Ganache desktop application, see https://trufflesuite.com/ganache[].

The +ganache-cli+ code can be found at https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli/[].

To install the command line +ganache-cli+, use +npm+:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ <strong>npm install -g ganache-cli</strong>
</pre>
++++

You can use +ganache-cli+ to start a local blockchain for testing as follows:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ <strong>ganache-cli \
  --networkId=3 \
  --port="8545" \
  --verbose \
  --gasLimit=8000000 \
  --gasPrice=4000000000;</strong>
</pre>
++++

A few notes on this command line:

* [ ] Check the `--networkId` and `--port` flag values match your configuration in _truffle-config.js_.
* [ ] Check the `--gasLimit` flag value matches the latest mainnet gas limit (e.g., 8,000,000 gas) shown at https://ethstats.net to avoid encountering &#x201c;out of gas&#x201d; exceptions unnecessarily. Note that a `--gasPrice` of +4000000000+ represents a gas price of 4 gwei.
* [ ] You can optionally enter a `--mnemonic` flag value to restore a previous HD wallet and associated addresses.(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc13")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc12")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_appdx-dev-tools-asciidoc11")))
